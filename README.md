# Maternal Health Coverage Analysis

This repository contains an R-based analysis of global maternal healthcare coverage, focusing on:

- *ANC4+ Coverage*: Percentage of women receiving ≥4 antenatal visits
- *Skilled Birth Attendance (SBA)*: Percentage of deliveries attended by skilled personnel

The goal is to evaluate differences in service coverage between *on-track* and *off-track* countries based on the Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) status.

## Repository Structure

- 01_rawdata/ – Source Excel data from UNICEF and UN WPP
- 03_scripts/ – Cleaning and analysis code
- outputs/ – Final PDF/HTML reports and plots
- test.Rmd – R Markdown script for full report generation

## Key Insights

- Population-weighted estimates reveal *higher ANC4+ and SBA coverage* in on-track countries.
- Off-track countries lag significantly, particularly in ANC4+.
- Recovery trends (2019–2022) show regional disparities and resilience gaps post-pandemic.
